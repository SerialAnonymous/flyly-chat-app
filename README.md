# Flyly
This is a chat application built on an unholy amalgamation of Node.js, socket.io, Apache and PHP.

The main aim of this is to create a [Slack](https://slack.com/) like platform, combined with the informality and familiarity of [WhatsApp](https://www.whatsapp.com).

## Technologies involved
+ Apache and PHP
+ MySQL
+ Node.js and Socket.io for realtime server push capability

Yes, I know.
